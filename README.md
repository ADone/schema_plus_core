## Development & Testing

Are you interested in contributing to SchemaPlusCore?  Thanks!  Please follow the standard protocol: fork, feature branch, develop, push, and issue pull request.

Some things to know about to help you develop and test:

* **schema_dev**:  SchemaPlusCore uses [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) to
  facilitate running rspec tests on the matrix of ruby, activerecord, and database
  versions that the gem supports, both locally and on
  [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/SchemaPlus/schema_plus_core)

  To to run rspec locally on the full matrix, do:

        $ schema_dev bundle install
        $ schema_dev rspec

  You can also run on just one configuration at a time;  For info, see `schema_dev --help` or the [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) README.

  The matrix of configurations is specified in `schema_dev.yml` in
  the project root.

* **schema_monkey**: SchemaPlusCore extends ActiveRecord using
  [schema_monkey](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_monkey)'s extension API and protocols -- see its README for details.  If your contribution needs any additional monkey patching that isn't already supported by [schema_monkey](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_monkey), please head over there and submit a PR.
